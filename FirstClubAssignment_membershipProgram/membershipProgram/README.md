# Membership Program Backend Service

A robust, enterprise-ready Spring Boot microservice designed for managing subscription-based memberships with dynamic tier progression, flexible benefit mapping, automated order-driven tier evaluations, and OAuth2 JWT security.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This backend system powers the membership ecosystem for an e-commerce platform. Users can subscribe to various plans (`MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, `YEARLY`), earn dynamic perks based on their active membership tier (`SILVER`, `GOLD`, `PLATINUM`), and automatically unlock higher tier levels as they place orders or meet specific activity criteria.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Flexible Subscriptions**: Comprehensive management of user subscriptions across standard billing cycles (`MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, `YEARLY`).
* **Dynamic Tier Evaluation Engine**: Strategy-pattern-driven evaluation logic that automatically checks user order count, monthly spend thresholds, and cohort assignments to upgrade user tiers seamlessly.
* **Configurable Dynamic Benefits**: Multi-type benefit management (`BOOLEAN`, `NUMERIC`, `STRING`) allowing admins to link, update, or unlink tier benefits on the fly without system downtime.
* **Asynchronous Event Architecture**: Non-blocking order event publication using Java Virtual Threads (`Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`) to perform tier re-evaluation in the background.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Stateless Spring Security 6 integration as an OAuth2 Resource Server with JWT claim converter mapping roles (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`).
* **OpenAPI 3.0 & Swagger UI**: Full interactive API documentation and testing interface out of the box.

## 🔮 Roadmap & Future Enhancements

### External Notification Microservice (TO DO)

A separate microservice will handle asynchronous user communications via event streaming (Kafka/RabbitMQ):

1. **Admin Modification Alerts**: Notify active subscribers immediately whenever an `ADMIN` updates or deletes a plan or tier benefit structure.
2. **Pre-Expiry Reminders**: Automatically dispatch reminder notifications to users **7 days prior** to their subscription expiration date.
3. **Expiration & Renewal Notifications**: Send immediate alerts when a membership expires, providing direct call-to-action links to renew or upgrade.
